  <meta name="description" content="#learned 088
 As I had not taken any devops related courses before, most of the stuff we learned during the course was new to me at least in theory. It was however nice to see that the theoretical aspects could quite easily be applied to my previous finding from my work, and getting the theoretical background also helps to better understand why certain things where done the way they were done in my previous employer’s operations."><script type="application/ld+json">

It was however nice to see that the theoretical aspects could quite easily be applied to my previous finding from my work, and getting the theoretical background also helps to better understand why certain things where done the way they were done in my previous employer’s operations.</p>

<p>The main thing that was left on my mind from the course was the culture aspect of the CAMS model, and especially how big of a role it plays in implementing the process change to a business. It’s not just about changing technical capabilities or replacing manual labor with delicate automation, but instead the whole company has to embrace the new operations model in order for it to be effective in the larger scale. I think this also calls for effective change leadership within the organization, so that the change to new operations model can be handled with as few obstacles as possible (e.g. instead of making just apparent changes in the technical execution, the staff also has to understand why the change was made and how it affects their work).</p>

<p>The most challenging part for me was actually setting up the advanced project work, since it has been a long time since I’ve last done any type of development on my own. It did surprise me a little, and motivated me to get back to the topic.</p>
