#this course 088

>This course peaked my interest while looking through the Fitech course list, as I have heard a lot of talk about devops and it’s necessity to modern businesses both in my studies and in my work. As I also want to have a comprehensive understanding of how companies run their IT departments (especially large ones with a lot of data to handle) and how the IT department can support the whole business side to streamline their processes and help them to make more profit, this topic is an important part of a puzzle for me.

>In addition to having an interested in the topic beforehand, I also wanted to take some courses through Fitech that actually have something to do with my major, as I’m currently doing an exchange semester abroad without the possibility to take courses directly related to computer science. This course (with a couple of others) serves as a gateway of keeping in touch with stuff I’ll continue working with after the semester has ended, instead of just doing minor studies.

>My expectations for the course content obviously align with my reasoning for taking the course – I expected to get the answers to the previously stated notes. In particular, I wanted to get a solid base for the topics covered in the course, so that I could build on that later on my own, both through further studies and especially through my future work life.
