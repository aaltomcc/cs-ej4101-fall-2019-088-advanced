# About

>I am a nth year student majoring in computer science. I'm mostly interested in connecting the expectations and needs of both IT and business together, and through my studies I aim to get a comprehensive view on both sides, so that I'll be able to do this in the future in my work.

>When it comes to topics related more closely to my major, I enjoy web development and especially the front-end side of it. Next I would like to focus on matters related to user experience, which would further support my aim of getting a wide understanding of different topics.
